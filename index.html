    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Marcus and I'm a bioinformatician and full-stack web developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was raised on a rural farm in Canada.
        Currently, I am the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at 
        <a href="www.cultivateci.com">CultivateCI</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With over a decade of experience in programming, microbiology, and business.
        I am happy to be back working in agriculture. 
        It's amazing how my first childhood microscrope has crafted my 
        career. 

        It's amazing how many people I have hired over my career and when I get the 
        resume I immediately google them, inspect their github, and look for their
        person websites. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My other passions include bioinformatics, microbiology & immunology, and startups. 
        I am currently associated with <a href="www.tinybison.io">Tiny Bison</a> 
        and love every minute of it!
    </p>
    <p>
        The website you are reading now is my simple website. 
        Built with HTML and hosted on github.
        Everything is hand-written, and 
        no frameworks were involved in this build or design.
    </p>
